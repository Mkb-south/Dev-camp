<h1>Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis The Wise?<br></h1>
<h2>No.</h2>
  <h3> I thought not. It's not a story the Jedi would tell you.  </h3>

<body>
  
 <p class="box">It's a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create lifeâ€¦ He had such a knowledge of the dark side, he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying.</p>
